          <h1 class="h1">Privacy Policy</h1>
          <p class="lead">This policy explains what we collect, how we use it, and the limited ways we share it.</p>

          <h2 class="h2">Information We Collect</h2>
          <p class="muted">
            We collect information you provide directly, such as your name, email address, and message
            when you use the contact form or email us. We also collect basic technical information that
            a browser typically sends, such as IP address, device type, pages viewed, and approximate
            location, which helps us keep the site secure and understand usage.
          </p>

          <h2 class="h2">How We Use It</h2>
          <p class="muted">
            We use information to respond to inquiries, evaluate potential engagements, provide services,
            improve the site, and protect the security and integrity of our systems. We do not sell personal
            information.
          </p>

          <h2 class="h2">Cookies &amp; Analytics</h2>
          <p class="muted">
            The site may use cookies or similar technologies for basic functionality and analytics. You can
            control cookies through your browser settings and may be able to opt out of certain analytics
            tracking depending on your browser or device.
          </p>

          <h2 class="h2">Sharing</h2>
          <p class="muted">
            We share information with service providers who help us operate the site (such as hosting or
            analytics providers), and only as necessary to provide those services. We may also disclose
            information if required by law or to protect our rights.
          </p>

          <h2 class="h2">Retention</h2>
          <p class="muted">
            We retain information for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes described above
            or as required by law, after which we will delete or anonymize it.
          </p>

          <h2 class="h2">Security</h2>
          <p class="muted">
            We use reasonable administrative and technical measures to protect information, but no
            method of transmission or storage is fully secure.
          </p>

          <h2 class="h2">Your Choices</h2>
          <p class="muted">
            You can request access to or deletion of your information by contacting us. You may also opt
            out of non-essential communications at any time.
          </p>

          <h2 class="h2">Children&#39;s Privacy</h2>
          <p class="muted">
            This site is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal
            information from children.
          </p>

          <h2 class="h2">Updates</h2>
          <p class="muted">
            We may update this policy from time to time. The latest version will be posted on this page
            with an updated effective date.
